# Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Testing with the iTCLab Kit

The most famous control system in the industry is the PID. PID combines three proportional, integral, and derivative control actions. Each of these control actions has certain advantages, where the proportional control action has the advantage of a very fast rise time, the integral control action has the advantage of reducing errors, and the derivative control action has the advantage of reducing errors or reducing overshoot. The purpose of combining these three control actions is to produce output with fast rise time and small errors.

To easily understand how the PID control system works, you can read the following tutorial (Indonesian version): https://www.academia.edu/101176526.

With the following simulation program using Python Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/bsrahmat/itclab-03/blob/main/pid_widget.ipynb.


In practice, control systems using PID controllers always require a plant. One of the plants we recommend is the Internet-Based Temperature Control Lab (iTCLab) plant.


iTCLab - Internet-Based Temperature Control Lab. Temperature control kit for feedback control applications with an ESP32 Microcontroller, LED, two heaters, and two temperature sensors. The heating power output is adjusted to maintain the desired temperature setpoint. Heat energy from the heater is transferred by conduction, convection, and radiation to the temperature sensor. Heat is also transferred from the device to the environment.

About these iTCLab kits :
- It is inspired by <a href="https://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl" target="_blank">The TCLab Product of Brigham Young University (BYU), one of the private campuses in Provo, Utah, United States of America.</a>
- Miniature Control System in a Pocket.
- Practical IoT Learning Package Tools.
- IoT programming Kits.
- IoT-Based Control System Practice Devices.
- It can be used to learn System Dynamics and Control Systems.
- It can be used to learn Arduino and Python programming.
- It can be used to learn AI and Machine Learning Programming.
- And others.

The underlying difference between TCLab and BYU's TCLab product is replacing the Arduino Uno microcontroller with ESP32. Using this ESP32, iTCLab can connect to the Internet of Things (IoT).
